## TicTacToe Server - Milestone 1

This milestone set up the basic structure for the TicTacToe Server. I created all the needed storage classes (like User and Event), 
defined the message packages (Request and Response) for sending info over the network, and built the main control classes (SocketServer, ServerHandler).
With all of this done, the project will soon be able to have an actual connection and game logic.
